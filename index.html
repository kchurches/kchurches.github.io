                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p id="about-me">Hello and thank you for visiting my website! My name is Kristyn Churches but you can call me Kris. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Advertising from Michigan State University and have previous employment experience working as a Marketing Coordinator, a retail worker, and a kennel worker at a veterinarian's office, among other things.</p>

                <h2>My Story So Far</h2>
                <div id="my-story">
                    <p>After I graduated from MSU in December of 2016, I moved home to live with my mom to save some money - and ended up staying for over a year (thanks, mom). During that time, I worked as an accounts payable bookkeeper as I searched for a marketing job that matched my experience and interests. Once I found employment, I was able to move out of my mom's house and into my own apartment. Shortly thereafter, I met and began dating my wonderful boyfriend, Kyle, whom I moved in with in February of 2020.</p>

                    <p>In December of 2020, Kyle and I were lucky enough to move into our very first house! She has a long history (101 years of history, in fact) and we're always discovering new issues but overall, we couldn't be happier.</p>
                        
                    <p>During this time, I bounced around between a couple different marketing jobs, struggling to find where I fit best. I was discovering that the passion I had for marketing during college was not transferring over into a career as I had hoped. Due to the consistent out-of-place feeling I was experiencing in my day-to-day responsibilities at my job, in February 2021 I decided to quit and take a leap of faith!</p>

                    <p>I had taken basic lessons in computer programming in high school and had been casually streaming on Twitch as I played video games for a couple months beginning in mid 2020. Suddenly, after I left my job, these two hobbies became the bulk of my day. I now am a Twitch Affiliate and am proficient in the three basic coding languages needed to build practically any website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).</p>
